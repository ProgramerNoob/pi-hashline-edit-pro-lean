A token-lean Pi wrapper around [`pi-hashline-edit-pro`](https://github.com/YuGiMob/pi-hashline-edit-pro). It pins the complete upstream `6.4.6` runtime while shortening persistent provider-facing tool text.

## Context footprint

<!-- token-benchmark:benchmark:start -->
With only this extension enabled, its recurring model-facing initialization contribution is:

| Variant | Tool and prompt contribution | Total |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Lean `pi-hashline-edit-pro-lean@6.4.6-lean.2` | `read` (147) + `grep` (146) + `replace` (254) + `replace_match` (195) + `insert` (131) + `copy` (216) + `move` (99) + `undo_last_change` (94) | **1,282** |
| Upstream `pi-hashline-edit-pro@6.4.6` | `read` (388) + `grep` (514) + `replace` (644) + `replace_match` (953) + `insert` (524) + `copy` (731) + `move` (707) + `undo_last_change` (271) | **4,732** |

This saves **3,450 tokens (72.9%)**.
Measured with Pi 1.2.0 in separate temporary processes with empty working directories and configuration. Built-in tools, skills, context files, session history, user messages, unrelated extensions, runtime UI, and slash commands are excluded; `before_agent_start` additions are included. Tokens are a fixed character-proxy estimate using `ceil(characters / 4)`, not provider tokenizer billing.

## What it keeps

- Four-character Hashline anchors and served-anchor validation.
- Safe anchor-only `replace`, `replace_match`, `insert`, `copy`, and `move` operations (no `path` by default), plus per-file undo.
- Anchored ripgrep results under the `grep` name, enabled by default.
- Hash store, automatic reads, file checks, write-echo protection, and upstream session hooks.
- The upstream runtime, schemas, and tool availability settings rather than a reduced reimplementation.
- Optional compatibility with the local `@local/pi-collapsed-tools.display-service.v1` decorator.

## Why it is lean

Only model-facing prose is trimmed, and every line is upstream's own wording condensed: concise descriptions, one-line tool-list snippets, and short versions of upstream's usage rules; each rule is said once, so parameter descriptions are removed except upstream's text for range bounds, copy's source and destination (move takes the same fields), and `text` (its newline note moves to the shared edit rule); no prompt resources and no rules of our own are added. Rules that upstream already enforces with an error naming the fix (unread range lines, overlapping batch ranges, stale anchors, path ownership) are left to that error instead of the prompt. The prompt keeps upstream's rules whose violation would silently produce a wrong edit or lose something an error cannot give back: the `anchor│content` row format, escape decoding, batch and single-slot undo, append and deletion semantics. Lines upstream shows only under some settings (replace_match or copy/move off, autoRead off, codemode on) follow those settings; upstream's tool-preference line, which it repeats on every tool, is kept once on `read`, and codemode-only guidelines pass through unchanged. Runtime behavior, defaults, validation, error contracts, and tool schemas are upstream's.

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/kunkun9527/pi-hashline-edit-pro-lean
```

Requires Pi `>=0.99.0`. Do not load another Hashline wrapper or the upstream package at the same time, or tools may be registered twice.

## Tools

```text
read
replace            # anchor-only: no path by default
replace_match      # exact substring inside an anchored range
insert             # anchor-only: no path by default
copy / move        # anchored line ranges, same or another file
grep               # anchored ripgrep; replaces Pi's built-in grep
undo_last_change   # still requires path
```

Always copy the four-character anchors returned by `read` or `grep`. Never invent anchors. `replace` and `insert` take one exact `text` string; line breaks inside it separate lines, and `text: ""` deletes the selected range in `replace`. Same-file edits in one message form one batch with a combined diff and a single undo.

Forgiving arguments: before validation, `replace` accepts the retired `replacement_text` / `replacement_lines` and `insert` accepts `lines` as `text`, and a `ref` equal to `path` is dropped. Anything ambiguous (including a missing `remove_to`, `path` or anchor) still fails validation.

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.config/pi-hashline-edit-pro/config.json` (or `$PI_HASHLINE_DIR/config.json`) and are shared with upstream. Use `/hashline-config` to change them.

Defaults are upstream's: all eight tools are on. Versions up to `6.4.5-lean.2` wrote `replaceMatchEnabled: false` (and older ones `copyMoveEnabled: false`) into the config on load; those values stay after upgrading, so turn the tools back on in `/hashline-config`, or set:

```json
{
  "copyMoveEnabled": true,
  "replaceMatchEnabled": true
}
```

Two upstream settings swap in Pi's plain tools: `anchorGrepEnabled: false` registers the built-in `grep`, and a model matched by `disableOnModels` gets the built-in `read` and `grep` with the edit tools off. Those plain tools keep Pi's own text.

## Upgrading from 4.x

- `replacement_lines` / `lines` arrays are replaced by the `text` string; `[]` becomes `""`.
- `anchor_grep` is now `grep` and replaces Pi's built-in `grep`.
- New `replace_match`, `copy`, and `move` tools, on by default and switchable in `/hashline-config`.
- A pure deletion verifies its boundary lines; interior lines that were never served are removed as they currently stand.

Start a fresh Pi session after upgrading so the model receives the new schemas and instructions.
